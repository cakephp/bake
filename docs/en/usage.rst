Code Generation with Bake
#########################

The Bake console is run using the PHP CLI (command line interface).
If you have problems running the script, ensure that:

#. You have the PHP CLI installed and that it has the proper modules enabled
   (eg: MySQL, intl).
#. Users also might have issues if the database host is 'localhost' and should
   try '127.0.0.1' instead, as localhost can cause issues with PHP CLI.
#. Depending on how your computer is configured, you may have to set execute
   rights on the cake bash script to call it using ``bin/cake bake``.

Before running bake you should make sure you have at least one database
connection configured.

You can get the list of available bake command by running ``bin/cake bake --help``
(For Windows usage ``bin\cake bake --help``) ::

    $ bin/cake bake --help
